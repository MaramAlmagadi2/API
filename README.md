# API


The API I decided to select is called RestCountries. What this API does is that it fetches details 
of the country chosen. The API displays many details, however for this assignment I decided to 
display the common name, official name, population, area, capital city(es) and language(s).
Keep in mind that the information displayed are outdated since the API is a bit old. The API 
chosen and information displayed is only for assignment purposes.
